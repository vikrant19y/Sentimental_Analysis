# Sentiment Analysis and Review Classification


The "Sentiment Analysis and Review Classification" project focuses on analyzing customer reviews using natural language processing techniques to determine sentiment and classify reviews into positive and negative categories. The project incorporates various data preprocessing, text vectorization, and machine learning techniques to achieve these objectives.

Project Goals:

1) Sentiment Analysis: The project aims to analyze customer reviews and determine the sentiment expressed in each review. Sentiment analysis involves identifying whether a review is positive or negative based on the language used.

2) Review Classification: The project involves classifying reviews into positive or negative categories using machine learning models. This classification helps in understanding the overall sentiment of customer feedback.

3) Handling Imbalanced Data: Addressing class imbalance is crucial to achieve accurate classification results. The project employs techniques like oversampling using RandomOverSampler to balance the dataset.

4) Text Vectorization: Text data cannot be directly used by machine learning algorithms. The project employs text vectorization techniques, including CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, to convert text reviews into numerical features that models can understand.

5) Hyperparameter Tuning: The project uses GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning for the Logistic Regression classifier, optimizing its performance.

6) Visualization: The project utilizes Seaborn to create visualizations such as heatmaps to better understand the distribution of review sentiment and helpfulness.

&) GitHub Repository: The project is documented and shared on GitHub, allowing others to understand the code, its purpose, and how different techniques are implemented.

Project Workflow:

Data Loading: The project starts by loading review data from a CSV file using Pandas.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to create new columns that represent helpfulness percentage and categorical %Upvote labels.

Sentiment Analysis: A subset of the data with positive and negative scores is selected. Sentiment analysis is performed to determine the sentiment of each review.

Review Classification: The selected reviews are classified into positive and negative categories using machine learning models. The project uses Logistic Regression and a DummyClassifier for comparison.

Handling Imbalanced Data: The RandomOverSampler is employed to address class imbalance and improve classification accuracy.

Text Vectorization: Text vectorization is crucial for turning text data into features suitable for machine learning. CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer are used.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is used to find optimal hyperparameters for the Logistic Regression model.

Visualization: Heatmaps are created using Seaborn to visualize the distribution of review sentiment and helpfulness.

Documentation: The project is documented with code explanations, and the GitHub repository is created for sharing and collaboration.

Project Impact:

The project's sentiment analysis and review classification techniques can be valuable for businesses to understand customer sentiment and feedback trends. By effectively categorizing reviews into positive and negative sentiments, businesses can gain insights into customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement. The project's codebase and techniques can serve as a foundation for future NLP projects and studies involving text data analysis and classification.
